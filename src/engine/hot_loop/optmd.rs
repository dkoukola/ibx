//! The option model of an option's market data (ibx#502), as the
//! reference runs it beside the option's top of book (recorded on the
//! reference 10.51, paper, 12/10/2026, regular hours, an AAPL call):
//!
//! - its entries: the top of book of the underlying, without the API marks;
//!   the model parameters of the underlying (687) and the model greeks of
//!   the option (732, 733) on the volatility exchange; once the model
//!   parameters came, the market data status of the underlying (398), then
//!   the status of the option with its volatilities (734 to 737). A plain
//!   snapshot also gets a streaming pair of the option, as the model's own.
//!   When the model parameters of the underlying are known already, the
//!   option's entries go at once, then the parameters and the status of
//!   the underlying (the snapshot of the recording);
//! - its cancels: for a stream, the underlying's status before the
//!   option's top of book, then the underlying's pair, the option's
//!   entries in descending code order with its status last, the model
//!   parameters; for a snapshot, the greeks, the underlying's status and
//!   parameters, the model's option pair, the underlying's pair, the
//!   volatilities and the option's status;
//! - its computations (see `control::optcalc::market`): a first pass about
//!   a second after the model greeks came, with tick 13 and ticks 10 to 12
//!   without volatility or greeks (the reference's model not computed
//!   yet), then the passes of the session's clock, each sending the ticks
//!   whose values changed.
//!
//! The session's clock (ibx#684): after its first pass, every model passes
//! on one clock for the whole session, shared across requests, cancels and
//! contracts, that ticks on the even seconds of the machine's wall clock.
//! Observed in the recordings of 13-16/10/2026 (the reference 10.51,
//! paper, 10 sessions, 5 to 124 stream passes each): the passes 0.00 to
//! 0.26 s after the even second; a request's first pass at once when its
//! data came, off the clock; what it lacked at the next tick. A snapshot
//! thus ends at the first even second after its first data.
//!
//! The underlying price of ticks 10 to 12 is the middle of the underlying's
//! bid and ask (its last without them): the reference's own differs from
//! it by up to half a cent at times (see the issue tracker).
//!
//! An order on an option or a futures option starts a model too (ibx#693),
//! the engine's own: the option's top of book is one of its entries, with
//! no API mark, and its computations go to no one. Observed in the
//! recordings of 13-16/10/2026 (the reference 10.51, paper, 5 option
//! orders and 1 futures option order, the first of their contract in the
//! session): the underlying's pair and model parameters, then the option's
//! pair and greeks, queued for the option's farm while it connects; then
//! the statuses and volatilities as a request's model. It was kept to the
//! end of each recording (13 to 40 s), with no cancel.
//!
//! A futures option order's model has an index part too (ibx#727), on a
//! farm of its own: the index the future's index names as its reference
//! (the ES future's index names the SPX index). Observed on paper,
//! 15/10/2026, before the open (the reference 10.51, an ES put ordered on
//! CME by conId, the first futures option order of the session): once the
//! definitions naming it were read, about 0.5 s after the future's
//! entries, its native top with its bid and ask pair, then its market data
//! status, on its own exchange, all queued while its farm connected; the
//! status said frozen, and 2 ms after it its frozen pair went out, then its
//! entry 613 on the volatility exchange. Kept to the end of the recording,
//! with no cancel.
